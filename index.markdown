[BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) needs your help making videos for the [BrickMMO TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brickmmo) and [BrickMMO Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brickmmo) channels. The goal of this hackathon is to create a video as similar as possible to this short video:

<video width="270" height="480" controls>
    <source src="videos/jake-sully-brickheadz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

You will be provided with everything you need to shoot and edit this video within three to six hours. This includes:

 - The [Adobe Premiere] file that was used to create the original video. This will include the intro and outro, audio and video clips that can be reused, and the original timeline. 
 - A new sealed LEGO® kit.
 - Lighting, camera, tripod, backdrop, and table.

## Steps

This hackathon will likely include three sessions. 

One three hour session for shooting. This will take place at Humber in the Virtual Propduction room CTI307. One three hour session for editing. This will take place during a regular class. And finally a short 20 minute session to present the videos and choose a winner!

### Day One: Shooting
